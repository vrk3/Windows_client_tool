"""GPU engine utilisation, adapter memory, and the adapter's facts.

Two sources, split the way the process engine splits hot from cold:

- **PDH**, held open across ticks, for utilisation and memory in use. It is
  the only interface that attributes GPU work the way Task Manager does,
  and a full sample costs 0.33 ms.
- **The DirectX registry**, read once, for the facts -- name, driver
  version, feature level, and the memory limits the live figures are
  measured against.

The discipline is the same as everywhere else in the engine: a value we
could not read is `None` with a reason, never `0`.
