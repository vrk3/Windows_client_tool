r"""A scan finishing after its tab is gone must not take the app down.

_OverviewTab and QuickCleanupTab connect **closures** to their workers'
signals, not bound methods. Qt auto-disconnects a bound method when its
receiver QObject is destroyed; it cannot do that for a closure, because
nothing tells it what the receiver is. So the connection outlives the
widget, and a scan that lands after teardown reaches into a deleted C++
object.

Found by a crash: two tabs from earlier tests were collected while their
workers were still running, and the next test that pumped the event loop
died with a faulthandler dump inside `_res`. In the app the same shape is
reachable at shutdown, and on any path that destroys the module's widget
while a sweep is in flight — which is exactly what a slow scan makes
likely.
