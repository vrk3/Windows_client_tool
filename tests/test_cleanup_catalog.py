"""The cleanup scanners are data, not 538 near-identical functions.

Each was the same three lines: expand some environment variables into paths,
hand each to `_make_item`, sum the sizes. A census found 430 that were a
plain path list and 79 more that differed only by a glob — 95% of 440 KB was
boilerplate around the 5% that was actually knowledge.

The Tweaks module already proved the shape: ~700 entries in JSON behind one
engine, with one structural test that asks every entry a question at once.
These are those questions, and none of them could be asked reliably by
reading 538 functions.

#
# All 542 scanners are now reachable. 404 of them were not: they loaded,
# they were exported, and no tab offered them, because the UI wired its
# categories by hand in four files and everything else simply existed.
# That is why 62 scanners could carry a glob bug that meant they never
# matched anything, and why ten pairs could point at identical paths,
# without anyone noticing — nobody was looking, because nobody could.
#
# The catalog-backed 461 come from `scanners_for(category)`, so a scanner
# is offered as soon as it is defined. The 81 hand-written ones are named
# explicitly in cleanup_module's SYSTEM_EXTRA / LOGS_EXTRA / LARGE_EXTRA,
# split by what they RETURN rather than where they look: scan_large_files
# finds 42 GB of the user's own documents, so it sits on Large Items with
# the other user-data scanners, never on a cache tab.

#: 542 once scan_virtual_disk_images split in two: an image whose
#: hypervisor is installed wants COMPACTING, one whose hypervisor is
#: gone is an orphan. The 11.05 GB .vdi here is the second kind —
#: VirtualBox was uninstalled and left it behind.
#:
#: 541 with the categories that had no scanner at all: package_cache and
#: minidump in the catalog, scan_orphaned_installer_packages (C:\Windows#: Installer was 1.02 GB and only its $PatchCache$ was covered) and
#: scan_virtual_disk_images (11.05 GB in one .vdi here) in code.
#:
#: 537 after two dead scanners were deleted: scan_old_restore_points
#: (measured the Win+X shortcuts folder while claiming to measure System
#: Restore shadow storage) and scan_recycle_bin_drive (byte-identical to
#: scan_recycle_bin). See tests/test_cleanup_readers_read_something.py.
#:
#: 536 hand-written + catalog until the three per-drive scanners landed
#: (per_drive_temp, per_drive_recycle_bin, per_drive_found_clusters). Of
#: 537 scanners exactly two had ever looked past C:, and they were
#: duplicates of each other; E:	emp held 20.36 GB nothing could find.
#:
#: 537 until scan_winsxs_cleanup was deleted. It ran DISM
#: /AnalyzeComponentStore from inside a SCAN — 25-30s elevated, holding the
#: Windows servicing lock, to produce something the Large Items "Analyze
#: WinSxS" button already produces on purpose. See
#: tests/test_cleanup_no_servicing_lock.py.
