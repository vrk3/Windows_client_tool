"""Every hard requirement must actually be importable.

`WMI>=1.5.1` sat in requirements.txt for months while `.venv` had no `wmi`,
and nothing said so. Five modules import it inside a `try:` and quietly lose
their data — Hardware Info, Reliability, Services, System Report, and the
Security Dashboard, which went as far as reporting a red "Insecure" verdict
because it could not ask about the TPM. The only trace was one line in the
session log:

    [ERROR] modules.reliability.reliability_reader: wmi package not installed

The requirements file could not raise the alarm either, because it also
listed packages the code deliberately does not use (`pyqtgraph`, whose only
mention in the source is `HAS_PYQTGRAPH = False  # intentionally False`), so
"declared but absent" had stopped meaning anything.
