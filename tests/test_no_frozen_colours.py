"""A colour literal in Python code is a colour frozen to one theme.

`core/semantic_colors.py` exists to prevent exactly this, and its docstring
states the arithmetic:

    A pane that writes #4ec9b0 has picked a colour for the dark theme and
    frozen it. That reads 7.7:1 on the dark pane and 1.98:1 on the light
    one, so the light theme got a pale smear where the dark theme got a
    clear "OK".

There were 400 such literals across 49 files when this test was written. The
module is right, the contrast tests behind it are right; adoption is the gap.

This is a RATCHET, not a gate. BUDGET only ever goes down, lowered in the
same commit that removes literals. Raising it is never the fix — if a new
pane needs a status colour, `semantic("success"|"warning"|"error"|"info"|
"match")` is the answer, and if it needs chrome, that is a rule in both
.qss sheets keyed on objectName.
