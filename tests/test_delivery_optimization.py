r"""Delivery Optimization is turned off by policy, not by killing the service.

Both places that offer this shipped a step Windows refuses outright:

    services.json  disable_delivery_optimization   {"type": "service",
                                                    "name": "DoSvc",
                                                    "start_type": "disabled"}
    perf_checks.py disable_delivery_optimization   the same, plus a detector
                                                   reading DoSvc\Start == 4

Measured with tools/service_config_probe.py, which writes nothing
(ChangeServiceConfig with SERVICE_NO_CHANGE for every field):

    elevated    DoSvc REFUSED; RemoteRegistry, DiagTrack, SysMain, WSearch,
                MapsBroker, RetailDemo, WMPNetworkSvc, lfsvc all ALLOWED
    unelevated  every one refused at OpenService, a step earlier

`sc sdshow DoSvc` grants Builtin Administrators DC (SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG), so
the DACL is not the obstacle: Windows protects that service beyond its own
permissions. The real 2026-08-29 run proves the consequence -- an elevated
session logged the refusal and DoSvc\Start is still 2, so the row read
"suboptimal" and applying it errored, every time, for everyone.

Killing the service was also the wrong instrument. DoSvc downloads updates
generally; peer-to-peer SHARING -- which is what both descriptions promise to
stop -- is the DODownloadMode policy, and this repo already turns it off that
way in three other tweaks (disable_peer_updates,
wu_disable_delivery_optimization_p2p, wu_delivery_optimization_lan_only). The
ids stay put: six built-in presets and the Performance Tuner reference them.
