r"""The categories that hold real bytes and had no scanner.

Measured against the two fixed drives on the machine this was written for,
diffing what the 537 scanners cover against what is actually on disk:

    NO       1.02 GB  C:\Windows\Installer      (only $PatchCache$ covered)
    NO       0.03 GB  C:\ProgramData\Package Cache
    NO           --   C:\Windows\Minidump
    NO      11.05 GB  E:\vms\ubuntu             (10 files: virtual disks)

Two of the gaps I expected to fill turned out to be covered elsewhere in
the app and are deliberately NOT duplicated here: hibernation is a Tweaks
power definition (`powercfg /h off`, not a file delete), and restore points
belong to the Restore Manager module, which already lists and deletes them.

The Windows Installer orphan scanner carries the one genuinely dangerous
question in this file, and it gets the most attention below: the cache
holds the .msi and .msp files Windows needs to REPAIR or UNINSTALL every
installed product. A file in there is junk only if no installed product
references it. If the reference list cannot be read, every file looks
orphaned — so a refused registry read must produce NOTHING, never 1 GB of
"safe to delete".
