r"""A tab should offer the scanners that apply to this machine.

Measured: 71 of 456 catalog specs match anything here.

    dev      8 / 121      games    3 / 83       apps   8 / 75
    media    1 / 50       cloud    3 / 38       comms  0 / 35
    browsers 7 / 13       system  41 / 41

The App & Game Caches tab listed 301 scanners for about a dozen that
apply, and Dev Tools listed 122 for eight. That is not a display quibble:
it is what a scan iterates, and it buries the entries that found something
under hundreds that never could.

The catalog keeps all of them — knowledge about where an application
caches things is worth having whether or not that application is installed
today — but a tab is built from the ones whose targets are actually on
this machine. The filter is applied when the tab is built, so installing
something new means restarting the app; that is a fair trade for not
walking 385 dead paths on every sweep.
