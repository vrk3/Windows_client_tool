r"""Opening a CbsPersist .cab without unpacking it by hand.

Windows 11 rolls CBS into `.cab` files -- there are four in
`C:\Windows\Logs\CBS` on this machine -- and the plain `.log` beside them is
usually the smallest part of the story.

Extracted with `expand.exe`, which ships with Windows. The existing CBS tab
uses 7-Zip, which is installed here but is not on most machines; depending on
it would make this work on the developer's box and nowhere else.

Two things real cabs do that a naive extractor gets wrong, both verified
against `C:\Windows\Logs\CBS`:

* the file INSIDE is named like the cab, extension and all, so "find the
  .log" finds nothing;
* it is 15.8 MB of text from a 465 KB cab, so the extraction has to be given
  somewhere with room and cleaned up afterwards.
