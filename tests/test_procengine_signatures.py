"""The Authenticode signature of a file.

The point that carries the file: **a signature is a fact about a FILE, not
about a process.** A machine loads the same hundred system DLLs in every
process, so the verdict is cached per path -- verifying ntdll.dll once is
the difference between verifying it once and once per process that loaded
it. That cache is the thing this file is really testing.

The statuses are separate facts, and the tests insist they stay separate:

- `valid` is an answer: `WinVerifyTrust` walked the chain and it held.
- `not_signed` is an answer: the file has no Authenticode signature at all.
- `invalid` is an answer: it WAS signed, and the signature has lapsed or
  was rejected -- a "distrusted" file is not the same as an unsigned one.
- `could_not_verify` is a REFUSAL with a reason, never a claim about the
  file. A missing file is not "unsigned", and a malformed PE is not either.

These run against real system files, so they are machine facts like the
rest of the engine's tests -- but the facts they assert are stable: the
Windows directory has been signed by Microsoft for every version of the
system this app targets.
