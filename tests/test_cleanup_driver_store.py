r"""Superseded third-party drivers, and why this one is written fail-closed.

`DriverStore\FileRepository` is 7.13 GB on the machine this was written for
— the largest single reclaimable figure found anywhere in the cleanup work,
and the one nothing could safely offer. The old `driver_store` catalog entry
pointed at the whole folder as a single deletable item; ticking it costs the
machine its drivers, so it is disabled with its reason kept.

Reclaiming that space properly means removing SUPERSEDED driver packages one
at a time, which is a set difference over `pnputil /enum-drivers`. Three
things about that command make this delicate, and all three are pinned here:

* **Unelevated it prints its HELP TEXT and exits 0.** No error, nothing on
  stderr. A parser trusting the return code reports "no superseded drivers"
  on every unelevated machine, forever — the same shape as `Get-Tpm`
  answering `{"TpmPresent":null}` and `gpresult /x` silently dropping the
  computer half. The refusal is detected by the ABSENCE of `Published Name:`
  records, never by rc.
* **The output is UTF-16.** Decoded as UTF-8 it is unparseable mojibake.
* **"Newer" is genuinely ambiguous sometimes.** On this machine `amdxe.inf`
  has oem60 at 09/09/2025 25.20.0.11 and oem53 at 09/23/2025 25.10.0.1 — a
  later DATE carrying a lower VERSION. Neither supersedes the other by both
  measures, so neither is offered. A wrong call here costs a driver.

Measured against the real 63-package output: 11 original names installed more
than once, and **11 packages superseded** — a naive all-but-the-newest rule
says 12, and the extra one is amdxe.inf's ambiguous pair, left alone.

The reclaimable figure is the other surprise. Of those 11, five have no
`DriverInfFiles` registry entry at all, so their size cannot be determined;
the six that can be measured come to **2 MB**. The 7.13 GB driver store is
almost entirely current, in-use drivers. Sizes that cannot be taken are
reported as unknown, never as zero.
