r"""A virtual disk nothing on the machine can open is a different thing.

`scan_virtual_disk_images` reports every large .vhd/.vhdx/.vdi/.vmdk as
`danger`, unselected, on the reasoning that the space is real but the way
to reclaim it is to COMPACT the image rather than delete it — deleting one
destroys a VM.

That reasoning assumes there is still a VM. On the machine this was
written for there is not:

    E:\VMs\Ubuntu\Ubuntu.vdi   11.05 GB, dated Feb 2026
    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Oracle       does not exist
    ~\.VirtualBox              does not exist
    ~\VirtualBox VMs           does not exist
    VBoxManage.exe             not on PATH, not in either Program Files

VirtualBox was uninstalled and left 11 GB behind. Nothing on this machine
can open that file, there is no VM to destroy, and no compaction tool
exists to shrink it — so "danger: compact, do not delete" is exactly the
wrong advice. It is an orphan, and saying so is the whole value.

Two scanners rather than one flag, because a ScanItem carries no label of
its own: the tab takes its label from the scanner, so the distinction has
to live at that level to reach the screen.
