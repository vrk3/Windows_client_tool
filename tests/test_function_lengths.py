"""No function grows past a couple of screens.

`LogViewerWidget.__init__` reached 480 lines before anyone noticed, in a
class of 105 methods over 2,136 lines. Nothing about it could be read or
tested a piece at a time; it is now seven named builders (audit #20).

This is a RATCHET on what remains: LIMIT only ever falls. It is not a
demand that the current long functions be split today — see the note below
on why several of them should not be split mechanically — but a new
function may not join them.
