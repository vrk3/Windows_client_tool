r"""User-data scanners must look where the user's data actually is.

Six scanners built their target list from `os.path.expanduser("~")` plus a
hardcoded folder name. Documents, Desktop and Pictures are routinely
redirected — OneDrive Backup does it by default, and Windows has always
allowed it. Measured on this machine:

    ~/Desktop        DOES NOT EXIST     OneDrive/Desktop     57 entries
    ~/Pictures       DOES NOT EXIST     OneDrive/Pictures  1989 entries
    ~/Documents      10 entries         OneDrive/Documents  225 entries

So Large Items, duplicates, old files and empty folders were all reporting
on a near-empty shadow of the real profile, silently — a missing directory
is not an error to any of them.

`SHGetKnownFolderPath` is what Explorer itself asks, and it answers with the
redirected path.

The second half is the trap that comes with the fix: once these scanners
reach the real OneDrive folders, anything that OPENS a file hydrates it —
Files On-Demand downloads the whole thing from the cloud. `_hash_file_fast`
opens every file in a size-collision group, so duplicate detection would
quietly pull gigabytes over the network. Placeholders are skipped by
attribute, without opening them.
