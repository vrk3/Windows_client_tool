"""Every pane must actually follow the light theme.

`ThemeManager.apply_theme()` only calls `QApplication.setStyleSheet()`. An
inline `widget.setStyleSheet("... background: #2d2d2d ...")` beats the
application sheet and is never revisited, so a pane that hardcodes its colours
stays dark forever while the rest of the app turns light. Light theme is not a
hidden setting: there is a "Toggle &Theme" menu item and a Settings combo.

A sweep of all 34 panes measured 13 of them rendering dark under the light
theme, and the split had no middle ground -- dominant background luminance
0.013-0.045 against 1.000 for the panes that behave. This test is that
measurement, kept.

Luminance, not a stylesheet grep, because a grep cannot tell which frames
actually carry text and cannot see a pane at all. It also cannot be fooled by
a colour that is themed correctly but painted by a delegate.

The consequence is worse than an inconsistent colour. A dark card whose label
sets no colour of its own takes `QLabel { color: #1e1e1e }` from `light.qss`:
the Security Dashboard's card titles measured 1.51:1 against their own
background, which is unreadable. Fixing the background fixes the text with it.
