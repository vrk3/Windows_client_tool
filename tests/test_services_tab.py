"""The Services tab, as a widget, plus its data-layer reuse.

Runs against the real machine: WMI's Win32_Service list is always there (a
service host refuses to expose nothing), so these tests assert structure
rather than exact contents. The scan needs a COM-initialised thread, so the
widget tests drive the real COMWorker path through a fake app's pool exactly
as the Startup-apps sibling tests do, and the data-layer test spawns its own
thread that does the COM init itself.

No service is ever started, stopped or restarted here: that needs elevation
and would disturb a real machine. The action path is exercised only for its
refusal -- a monkeypatched `service_action` returning (False, []) -- to pin
that the tab reports the failure it is given instead of inventing success.
