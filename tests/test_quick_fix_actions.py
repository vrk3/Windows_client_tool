"""Quick Fix's repair actions, driven without touching the machine.

`fix_actions.py` was 18% covered — the lowest of any module that runs
commands, and it runs the most dangerous ones in the app: `chkdsk /f /r /x`,
`netsh winsock reset`, deleting the Windows Update download store,
`taskkill /f /im explorer.exe`.

Every one of these was reachable only by pressing the button on a real
machine, so nothing checked that the command was the command intended,
that a failure was reported rather than swallowed, or that output reached
the pane at all. These tests substitute the process layer and assert on
what would have been run.
