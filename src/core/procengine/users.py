r"""Task Manager's Users tab: every process, filed under the account it runs as.

The Details tab lists 284 rows; the Processes tab rolls them up into Apps.
The Users tab asks a different question -- not "what is running" but "what
is EACH ACCOUNT costing this machine". One row per user, expandable to the
processes that user runs, with CPU, memory and disk summed across them.

**Grouping is by the account, and the account is read, not guessed.** The
user comes from the process token (`details.user`), the same signal the
Details tab shows. Nothing here assumes a process is SYSTEM because of its
name or its path -- the account is the fact.

**A user that could not be read is not filed under somebody else.**
Unelevated, half this machine's processes refuse their token (details.py
records 133 of 275). Those processes have no readable account, so they
cannot be attributed to anyone -- dumping them under the current user
would charge that person for SYSTEM's work, and filing them under a made-up
"Unknown" row that looks like a real account is nearly as wrong. They get
their own row that SAYS what it is, with a count and a reason, the way the
Details tab's status line already admits what it cannot see.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.
