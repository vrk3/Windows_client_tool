r"""Find which process has a file, key or DLL open -- Process Explorer's Ctrl+F.

The question this answers is the one that makes a process explorer worth
having: *what is holding this file open?* It is asked about a path that
cannot be deleted, a registry key that will not budge, a DLL that should
have been unloaded.

Measured on this machine, and the reason the search is shaped the way it
is:

| Step | Cost | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| enumerate every handle | 143 ms | 164,173 handles, 266 processes |
| name all of them | ~0.5 s | most objects have no name at all |
| read every process's modules | 1,273 ms | 15,391 modules, 21 refused |

So the whole sweep is about two seconds. That is fast enough to be worth
doing on demand and far too slow to do on a keystroke, which is why this
is a function a caller runs on a worker with `should_stop`, not a filter
over something already in memory.

**Both halves report what they could not look at.** Twenty-one processes
refuse their module list outright, and unelevated far more refuse handle
duplication. A search that quietly skipped them would answer "nothing has
that file open" when the honest answer is "nothing I was allowed to look
at has it open" -- and for this particular question, that difference is
the whole point of asking.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.

#: a loaded machine -- and when it trips, that process loses every name
#: after the cut. It cost real debugging: a search for a file THIS process
#: had open kept coming back empty, because our own handle-heavy process
#: was the one being cut off.

#: Naming measures ~0.003 ms a handle, so 2 ms each is ~600x headroom --
