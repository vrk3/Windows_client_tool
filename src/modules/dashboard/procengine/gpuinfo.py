r"""GPU utilisation, adapter memory, and the facts about each adapter.

Two sources, and the split is the engine's usual one -- what changes every
second against what never changes.

**Hot: PDH, with the query held open.** There is no `NtQuerySystemInformation`
for the GPU the way there is for processors and memory; the scheduler's
accounting reaches user mode only through the performance counters. Four
counter sets matter:

| Set | What it gives |
|---|---|
| `GPU Engine` | one instance per (process, physical engine), utilisation |
| `GPU Adapter Memory` | dedicated and shared bytes in use, per adapter |
| `GPU Process Memory` | the same, per process -- for the Details column |
| `GPU Local Adapter Memory` | the on-card half, on partitioned adapters |

Measured on this machine: 483 engine instances, and a full sample of all of
them costs **0.33 ms** -- as long as the query stays open. PDH does the
delta itself and keeps the instance list; reopening it every tick would
re-enumerate 483 counters instead.

Two consequences of the counters being percentages worth stating up front:

- **The first collection has no answer, and PDH says so** by failing
  `PdhGetFormattedCounterArray` with `PDH_INVALID_DATA` rather than
  returning zeros. That lands exactly on the rule the rest of the engine
  keeps, so it is passed through as `None`, not smoothed into 0%.
- **English counter names, always** (`AddEnglishCounter`). The counter set
  is called "GPU Engine" only on an English install; the localised name is
  what `\GPU Engine(*)\...` would have to spell everywhere else. This is
  the same trap as matching the loopback adapter by name.

**Cold: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectX`.** One subkey per adapter DirectX
has ever seen, carrying the name, driver version, feature levels and the
memory limits -- which is where Task Manager's GPU panel gets them. It is
read once and joined to the live sample by LUID.

Notably NOT from WMI: `Win32_VideoController.AdapterRAM` is a signed 32-bit
field, and this machine's 24 GB card reports **-1048576** through it. WMI is
consulted for one thing the registry does not carry, the driver date, and
that join is on the PCI vendor and device ids rather than on the name.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.
