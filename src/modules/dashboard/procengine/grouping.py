r"""Task Manager's Apps / Background / Windows split.

The Processes tab does not show a flat list -- it shows three groups, and the
grouping is the whole reason that tab is readable when the Details tab is
not. `chrome.exe` twelve times under "Google Chrome" is one row someone can
reason about.

**What makes something an App is a visible window, not a guess about its
name.** Task Manager asks the window manager; anything else is a heuristic
that gets `explorer.exe` wrong on one machine and `Code.exe` wrong on the
next. So this enumerates top-level windows once per refresh and asks which
pid owns each -- one `EnumWindows` pass, measured below.

Everything left over splits into Windows processes and background processes
on two signals: the token where it can be read (`SYSTEM`, `LOCAL SERVICE`,
`NETWORK SERVICE`), and session 0 where it cannot. The second is what makes
this work for an ordinary user -- 135 of this machine's 284 processes refuse
their token, every system process among them, so on the token alone the
Windows group came out empty. Neither signal is the PATH, so a user-installed
service running as SYSTEM is filed under Windows and a user's own program in
System32 is not.

Qt-free: `EnumWindows` is a plain Win32 call, and none of this needs a
widget.
