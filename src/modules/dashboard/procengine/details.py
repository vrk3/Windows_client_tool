r"""The per-process facts that cost a handle open.

Path, command line, user, integrity, elevation, architecture, description --
none arrive with the bulk syscall, and each one needs the process opened.
Doing that for every process every tick is exactly the 668 ms
`ntquery.py` exists to avoid.

So they are COLD: resolved once, cached for the life of the process, keyed by
`(pid, create_time)` because Windows reuses pids and serving the dead
process's path for its successor is how a process manager shows the wrong
program's name.

**A refusal is not an answer.** The rule the Security Dashboard, Group Policy
and the tweak engine all follow, applied here: a value we could not read is
`None` with a reason beside it, never `""`. A blank cell reads as "this
process has no path"; "access denied" reads as what actually happened. This
matters more than usual here because plenty of processes on a normal machine
are unreadable to an unelevated caller, and a pane full of blanks looks
broken rather than restricted.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.
