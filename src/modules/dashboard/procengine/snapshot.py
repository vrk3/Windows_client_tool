"""One reading of the machine, joined and shaped.

Brings the three sources together -- the bulk syscall (`ntquery`), the rate
maths (`rates`) and the cold cache (`details`) -- and builds the parent/child
tree the process view draws.

The tree is the interesting part. A parent pid is only a NUMBER: the parent
may be long dead with its pid reused by something unrelated. Joining on the
number alone is how a process tree ends up claiming Notepad started sixty
services. So a parent link is accepted only when the parent was created
BEFORE the child -- the same test Process Explorer applies.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.
