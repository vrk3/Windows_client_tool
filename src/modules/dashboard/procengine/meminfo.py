r"""What memory the machine has and where it has gone.

`GetPerformanceInfo` returns, in one call, almost exactly Task Manager's
Memory panel: committed and its limit, physical total and available, the
system cache, and the paged and non-paged kernel pools. It also carries the
process, thread and handle totals the CPU panel shows, so both panels are fed
from here.

**Every figure it returns is in PAGES, not bytes** -- except `PageSize`
itself, which is how you convert them. Reporting them raw understates memory
by a factor of 4096, and the numbers still look plausible, which is the
dangerous part: 8 GB of commit reads as 2 MB rather than as an obvious error.

Two things come from elsewhere because that call does not have them:

- **Hardware reserved** is installed RAM minus what the OS can see, and
  installed RAM needs `GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory`. On this machine
  the gap is real and Task Manager shows it.
- **Speed, slots and form factor** are per-DIMM facts from WMI, which is slow
  and cannot go on a once-a-second path. They are read once, on demand.

Qt-free, like the rest of the engine.
