"""The Details tab, as a child module of the Dashboard.

Thin: the widget is `DetailsTab` and everything real lives there or in
`procengine/`. This exists so the tab can be hosted by `CompositeModule` like
any other child, and so it can be tested on its own.

Not `requires_admin`. Unelevated it still shows every process and every
number the kernel gives up for free -- about half the machine's paths and
users are refused, and the pane says so rather than pretending. Gating the
whole tab behind elevation would hide a table that is most of the way useful
without it.

This module also owns the Dashboard's global-search provider (W5-04): one
place for the process data, so Details and Processes do not each register a
second provider that would double every hit.
