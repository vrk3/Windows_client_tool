"""Exposes live processes to the app's global search bar (W5-04).

Every dashboard tab has its own search box, but the app's global search --
the bar in the MainWindow that queries every module -- could not find a
process. That is the gap this fills: type a name, pid, user or command
line in the global bar and the process is a hit.

The query reads the machine ON DEMAND rather than holding a cache. The
bulk syscall costs ~2.6 ms for the whole machine (`ntquery` measures it),
so a live read is cheaper than keeping a snapshot in sync -- and it can
never answer with a process that died a second ago, which a stale cache
would do.

Cold details (path, command line, user) are resolved per hit, lazily, the
same way the Details tab resolves them -- unelevated half the machine
refuses, and a refusal is not an answer, so a process whose command line
or user could not be read still matches on what could be (name, pid) and
its result says so.

Qt-free: it reads through the engine, so it is testable headless.
