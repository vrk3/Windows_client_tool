"""The Users tab, as a child module of the Dashboard.

Thin: the widget is `UsersTab` and everything real lives there or in
`procengine/`. This exists so the tab can be hosted by `CompositeModule` like
any other child, and so it can be tested on its own.

Not `requires_admin`. Unelevated it still files every process whose token
it can read, and the "Accounts not readable" row says plainly what it
cannot -- gating the whole tab behind elevation would hide the accounts a
person can already see.
