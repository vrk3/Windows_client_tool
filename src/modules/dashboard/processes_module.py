"""The Processes tab, as a child module of the Dashboard.

Thin: the widget is `ProcessesTab` and everything real lives there or in
`procengine/`. This exists so the tab can be hosted by `CompositeModule` like
any other child, and so it can be tested on its own.

Not `requires_admin`. Unelevated it still shows every process and every
number the kernel gives up for free -- about half the machine's paths and
users are refused, and the pane says so rather than pretending. Gating the
whole tab behind elevation would hide a table that is most of the way useful
without it.
