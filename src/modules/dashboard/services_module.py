"""The Services tab, as a child module of the Dashboard.

Thin: the widget is `ServicesTab` and the reading comes from the existing
`services_manager.services_module` data layer (WMI). This exists so the tab
can be hosted by `CompositeModule` like any other child, and so it can be
tested on its own.

Not `requires_admin`: the table is a WMI read anyone can do, and the
Dashboard's other tabs all run unelevated. The start/stop/restart actions
need elevation and are refused by the OS when the app is unelevated -- the
tab reports that refusal rather than pretending. Gating the whole tab behind
elevation would hide a list that is fully readable without it.
