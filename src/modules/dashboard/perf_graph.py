"""The graphs on the Performance tab.

Pure `QPainter`, like `perfmon_charts.py` next door -- no pyqtgraph, no
matplotlib. Two widgets:

- `PerfGraph`, one filled history plot with Task Manager's grid.
- `CoreGrid`, the wall of small per-core plots.

**Every coordinate handed to a PyQt6 draw call is cast to `int`.**
`drawLine`, `fillRect`, `drawText` and `drawPolygon` reject a float and raise
a TypeError -- and this raises inside `paintEvent`, a reimplemented Qt
virtual, where an exception goes to `sys.excepthook` and then `qFatal()`.
Uncatchable, and the window dies. That rule is already recorded in CLAUDE.md
for the PerfMon charts; it applies here for the same reason.

The history is a `deque` with a fixed maximum, so a graph left running for a
day costs the same as one left running for a minute.
