"""The Process Explorer tab's snapshot, on the Dashboard's process engine.

It used to call `psutil.process_iter` with ten attributes, which the wave-1
benchmark measured at **667.9 ms** for this machine's ~270 processes against
**2.6 ms** for `NtQuerySystemInformation` -- a 257x gap that showed up in the
UI as a tab which sat empty for about five seconds after you clicked it, and
then burned two thirds of a core to stay current at 1 Hz.

The engine in `modules/dashboard/procengine/` already had everything this
pane needs, so this is now a translation layer rather than a second
collector: `SnapshotSource` reads, and each `ProcessInfo` becomes the
`ProcessNode` that `ProcessTreeModel` and the lower panes already expect.
That also fills in the GPU column, which had shown 0.0 for every process
since it was added because nothing ever wrote to it.

Two things are deliberately kept from the old behaviour: the shape of
`ProcessNode` (the tree model, the colour scheme, the properties dialog and
seven lower panes all read it) and the `{pid: node}` snapshot contract.
