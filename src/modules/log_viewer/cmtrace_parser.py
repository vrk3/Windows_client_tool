"""CMTrace / ConfigMgr log parsing.

One record is `<![LOG[message]LOG]!>` followed by an attribute blob:

    <![LOG[Starting]LOG]!><time="13:45:12.345+000" date="08-20-2026"
      component="UpdatesHandler" context="" type="1" thread="1234"
      file="updateshandler.cpp:112">

`type` is what the colouring hangs off: 1 Info, 2 Warning, 3 Error.

Anything that is not CMTrace falls back to a best-effort line parse. A viewer
that shows nothing for an ordinary `.log` is worse than one that shows
uncoloured lines.

No Qt here, so the parsing rules are testable without a display -- the same
split the CBS and DISM parsers use.

#: slice the front off the message, so the layout is decided PER LINE.
_TID = re.compile(r"\bTID=(\d+)")

#: Continuation lines indent 0, 2 or 4 spaces to show structure (CSI's
