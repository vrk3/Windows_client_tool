r"""Snapshot, apply, count down, revert.

Every display change goes through here. A resolution or refresh rate a
monitor cannot show leaves you looking at "no signal", and the control that
would put it back is on a screen you can no longer read — so the change
undoes itself unless someone confirms it. Windows does the same thing for the
same reason.

Two rules matter more than the countdown:

* **The confirm must land on a screen that still exists after the change.**
  Parenting it to the display the change just switched off is precisely the
  failure this guard exists to prevent.
* **A failed apply starts no countdown**, and a change with no way back never
  happens at all. If the snapshot cannot be taken, there is no undo, so the
  change is refused rather than attempted hopefully.

The decision logic is kept as plain functions so it can be tested without a
display; only `CountdownOverlay` needs Qt.

class RevertCountdown:
    """"Keep these changes?", counting down to no.

    Doing nothing REVERTS. That is the whole design: a mode the monitor
    cannot show leaves someone looking at a black screen, unable to click
    anything, and the safe outcome has to be the one that needs no input.

    Not a QDialog: `exec()` would block the caller inside a modal loop while
    the display is in an unknown state. It is a frameless always-on-top
    window driven by a QTimer, so the app keeps running and the revert fires
    from the event loop like anything else.
