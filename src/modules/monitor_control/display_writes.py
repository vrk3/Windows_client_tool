r"""Everything in Monitor Control that changes a display.

Deliberately one file. `display_config` and `display_modes` say what is and
what is possible, and both promise in their own docstrings to be read-only;
keeping that promise means the dangerous half lives here, where it can be
reviewed in one place.

A resolution or refresh rate a monitor cannot show leaves the user looking
at "no signal", and the control that would undo it is on the screen that
just went dark. So this refuses more readily than it acts:

* **A mode the device does not enumerate is refused, not attempted.** A
  driver will often accept a plausible-looking mode and then show nothing.
* **No mode list means no permission.** An enumeration that could not be
  read is "we do not know", never "go ahead".
* **`DISP_CHANGE_RESTART` is not success.** It means the mode was accepted
  and is not in effect; reporting it as done leaves someone staring at the
  old mode wondering what happened.
* **Deactivating the last active display is refused.** Windows will do it,
  and the result is a machine with no visible output.
* **Multi-monitor changes are staged and committed once.** Applying each
  device as it is set produces a visible cascade and can transiently leave
  two monitors sharing an origin.

Nothing here is called without going through `_apply_guard`, which
snapshots first and reverts on a timeout.
