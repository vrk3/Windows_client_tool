r"""DDC/CI over Dxva2.dll -- brightness, contrast and input source.

This is the engine half of Monitor Control: no Qt, no display needed, and
every call into the driver goes through one small `Dxva2Api` object so the
logic above it can be tested against a fake.

The path Windows makes you walk is
`EnumDisplayMonitors` -> `GetNumberOfPhysicalMonitorsFromHMONITOR` ->
`GetPhysicalMonitorsFromHMONITOR` -> `GetVCPFeatureAndVCPFeatureReply` /
`SetVCPFeature` / `CapabilitiesRequestAndCapabilitiesReply` ->
`DestroyPhysicalMonitors`.

Four things about real monitors shape everything here:

* **Plenty of monitors never answer.** DDC/CI ships disabled in a lot of OSD
  menus, and some panels answer a read and quietly ignore the write. So a
  monitor is never assumed controllable: `probe()` asks, and reports
  `responded=False` WITH the driver's own reason. A refused read is never
  turned into a value -- a `GetVCPFeatureAndVCPFeatureReply` that fails means
  "we could not ask", not "brightness is 0".
* **BOOL TRUE is not proof.** A reply carrying a maximum of 0 for a
  continuous control is junk, not a control with no range, and it is reported
  as "did not give a usable answer" rather than as a 0..0 slider.
* **Input source values past the standard three are vendor-specific.** MCCS
  defines 0x0F DisplayPort-1, 0x11 HDMI-1, 0x12 HDMI-2, and monitors add
  their own freely. The only honest list is what the capabilities string
  claims for VCP 0x60; when there is no capabilities string there is no list,
  and `set_input_source` refuses rather than guessing. Guessing here switches
  the monitor away from the machine that is driving it, which the user then
  cannot undo from this app.
* **Physical monitor handles leak.** They must go back through
  `DestroyPhysicalMonitors`, so `open_monitors()` is a context manager and is
  the intended way in; `list_physical_monitors()` hands you live handles and
  pairs with `close_physical_monitors()`.

A monitor that is connected but not on the desktop (switched off, or an input
the GPU is not driving) has no HMONITOR at all, so it is simply not in the
list. That is "not present", and it is a different thing from "present but
mute" -- which is what `DdcCapability.responded` records.
