r"""Display-audio endpoints: which monitor carries which sound device.

A monitor connected over HDMI or DisplayPort brings an audio endpoint with
it. Windows names those endpoints per display — "2 - MO27Q28G" — which is
the only thread tying an audio device back to a panel, and it is a thin one.

Everything here reads. Enumeration goes through
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\Audio\Render`,
which needs no elevation and no COM; the default output device goes through
`IMMDeviceEnumerator::GetDefaultAudioEndpoint` over a raw ctypes vtable,
because `comtypes` is not a dependency of this project and is not being made
one.

**THE COM WRITE PATH IS UNVERIFIED.** `set_endpoint_enabled` drives
`IPolicyConfig::SetEndpointVisibility`, an undocumented interface that
Microsoft has never published a header for. Nothing in this file has ever
been executed against a real endpoint: disabling the wrong one takes the
sound off the machine, and the machine this was written on was in use. Both
write paths are therefore behind a `confirm_supervised=True` interlock, and
refuse otherwise — see `SupervisionRequired`. Before either is trusted it
needs a supervised round-trip: disable -> re-read the state -> re-enable ->
re-read, on an endpoint nobody is listening to, confirming that the state
actually moved and actually came back.

Four things about the real data would break an implementation written from
the documentation alone. All four are handled here rather than found later.

* **`DeviceState` carries undocumented bits.** The live display endpoints on
  the reference machine report `0x10000001`: ACTIVE (1) *plus* an
  undocumented `0x10000000`. `raw == DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE` is False for those,
  so equality reports the monitors that are playing audio right now as being
  in an unknown state. Only the documented nibble is ever compared; the rest
  is reported by `undocumented_state_bits`, not discarded.

* **Most endpoints are ghosts.** 21 of 25 on the reference machine are
  NOTPRESENT — every headset, dock and monitor ever plugged in. Anything
  assuming the registry lists present hardware picks a device that has not
  existed for years.

* **Endpoint names are not unique.** The same panel appears as both
  "2 - MO27Q28G" and "4 - MO27Q28G" here, remembered on two display indices.
  Two *identical* monitors go further and produce two identically-named live
  endpoints, which nothing in the registry can tell apart.

* **Mapping a monitor to an endpoint is therefore FALLIBLE.** When more than
  one live endpoint answers to a name, `endpoint_for_monitor` returns None
  and `ambiguous_matches` returns the contenders. Picking one would be a coin
  flip presented as an answer.

Sources for the `IPolicyConfig` vtable layout, which is the one number in
this file that cannot be checked without writing:

* https://github.com/DanStevens/AudioEndPointController/blob/master/EndPointController/PolicyConfig.h
* https://docs.rs/com-policy-config/latest/src/com_policy_config/lib.rs.html

Both give the same order for IID `{f8679f50-...}`: three IUnknown slots, then
GetMixFormat, GetDeviceFormat, **ResetDeviceFormat**, SetDeviceFormat,
GetProcessingPeriod, SetProcessingPeriod, GetShareMode, SetShareMode,
GetPropertyValue, SetPropertyValue, SetDefaultEndpoint, SetEndpointVisibility
— putting SetEndpointVisibility at vtable index **14**, not 12. Index 12 is
`SetPropertyValue(PCWSTR, const PROPERTYKEY&, PROPVARIANT*)`; calling that
with a string and an int passes an integer where a `PROPERTYKEY*` is
expected. The older `IPolicyConfigVista` IID `{568b9108-...}` omits
ResetDeviceFormat and lands SetEndpointVisibility at 13, which is why both
constants exist and why the Vista IID is tried as a fallback.
