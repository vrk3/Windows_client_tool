r"""Named display profiles, keyed on EDID.

A profile is "this is what my desk looks like": every monitor, its resolution,
refresh, position, orientation, and which one is primary. Saving one is easy.
Applying one correctly rests entirely on **which monitor is which**, and that
is the only genuinely hard decision in this file.

**Three identifiers Windows offers are all wrong for this, and each one looks
right until it isn't:**

* `\\.\DISPLAY1` / `\\.\DISPLAY2` are *positions in a list*. On this machine
  the Gigabyte is DISPLAY1 and the Dell is DISPLAY2; swap the two DisplayPort
  cables and the names swap while the monitors have not moved. A profile that
  restored 2560x1440@144 "to DISPLAY2" would then configure the other panel.
* The CCD **target id** (256, 264, 265 here) is an adapter output number. It
  identifies the port, not the thing plugged into it.
* The **UID in the device path** (`...&UID256#...`) is the same target id in
  another costume, so the device path is not stable either.

So identity is the **EDID**: manufacturer (a PNP three-letter code), product
code, and serial number. That triple survives a reboot, a re-plug into
another port, a driver reinstall, and a GPU swap. It is read from
`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\DISPLAY\<hwid>\<instance>\Device
Parameters\EDID`, which is readable **unelevated** — measured on this machine.

Two byte orders in the EDID are not guessable and are the classic way to get
this wrong: the manufacturer id at bytes 8-9 is **big**-endian, and the
product code at bytes 10-11, two bytes later in the same header, is
**little**-endian. Get them right and `manufacturer + product_code`
reproduces the hardware id in the device path exactly (`GBT273C`, `DELD0E6`),
which is a free correctness check and is what the tests assert.

Serial numbers come from two places and both are needed. The 0xFF descriptor
block holds an ASCII serial when the manufacturer bothered; the Gigabyte here
has one (`25362F004687`) while its 4-byte numeric serial is the `0x01010101`
filler. The LG is the other way round: no 0xFF block at all, so its numeric
serial (292849) is the only thing distinguishing it from a second identical
LG. A parser that reads only one of the two leaves monitors unidentified.

**Refusals are never rounded off to answers.** A monitor whose EDID could not
be read gets `identified = False` and a `reason`; it is not quietly keyed on
its device path, because a key that looks stable and is not is exactly the
failure this module was designed to prevent. `can_apply` then refuses, naming
the monitor.

`apply_profile` is the only thing here that could change the machine, and it
will not do so without `confirm=True`; without it you get the plan.

No Qt, no `App` import — the app data directory is computed the same way
`app.py:_get_app_data_dir` computes it, exactly as `gpresult/rsop_snapshot.py`
does, so this module is testable headless.

    without it you get the plan and nothing is written. The default of a
    function that rearranges someone's monitors is "tell me what you would
    do".

    The write itself goes through `ChangeDisplaySettingsExW` per GDI device
    with `CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY | CDS_NORESET`, followed by one
    `ChangeDisplaySettingsExW(NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL)` to commit them
    together — the documented multi-monitor sequence. Applying each device
    immediately instead produces a visible cascade of mode changes and can
    transiently overlap two monitors at the same origin.

    Identities are resolved to `\\.\DISPLAYn` here, at apply time, and never
    read from the profile: that name is a list position (see the module
    docstring).

    `devices` overrides that resolution with an EDID-key → device-name map.
    It exists so the plan can be built and asserted against without a
    matching monitor physically attached — the plan is pure decision-making
    and should not need the hardware to be exercised.
