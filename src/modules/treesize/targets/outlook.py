"""Outlook mailbox scan target through MAPI (spec 6.2).

Read-only, deliberately: Pro reads a mailbox to show where the space went, and
a disk-usage tool has no business deleting mail. `supports_file_ops()` is
False, so the pane hides the destructive actions rather than showing them
disabled.

The mailbox is walked with the injected `client` -- a MAPI folder object --
which is what lets the folder/item tree be tested without Outlook installed.
Pro bundles Redemption64.dll for this; plain MAPI through pywin32 gets the
folder and item sizes, which is what the views need.
