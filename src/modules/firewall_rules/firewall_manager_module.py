        same thing as the text fitting: Qt's advance width for a string also
        moves with the display's DPI, the installed UI font and the Windows
        text scale. 70px held "Allow" on the CI runner and clipped it at 72px
        here — a real failure of the rule, which read as a flaky test.

        So each column is also measured against its own exemplar and its
        header, and the wider of constant-and-measurement wins. Only columns
        with something definite to fit have an exemplar: Name is deliberately
        allowed to elide (every cell carries the full value as a tooltip),
        and sizing it to its widest real value would put a 544-rule table at
        the cap on every column.
