"""Revert is a write, and gets the same verification as any other.

`_ToggleCard.configure` defaulted `revert_fn` to `toggle_fn`, so Revert called
the setter with the opposite argument -- a guess about the previous value, and
simply wrong for anything multi-valued. BackupService already records the real
`before_value` per step and deletes a value that did not exist before, so the
revert itself is its job. What is left is knowing whether it took, and that is
this module.

The two rules from `applier.py` carry over unchanged, because a revert is a
write like any other:

* **BackupService reporting success is not evidence the machine moved.** The
  control is read afterwards. With a known prior value the reading is compared
  to it; without one, the weaker check is that the reading CHANGED -- a revert
  that reports success and leaves the setting exactly as it was has not been
  verified, whatever the writer says.
* **The snapshot caches are dropped before the check, once per batch.** 135 of
  the 149 readers answer out of `snapshots.py`, whose cache has no expiry.
