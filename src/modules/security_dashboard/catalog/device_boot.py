"""Device, firmware and boot-path controls.

Most of this category is read-only, and for a reason that is worth stating
once: **firmware is not a Windows setting.** Secure Boot, the TPM and the
UEFI/legacy mode are read by Windows and changed in the firmware setup screen.
A switch here would be a button that cannot work.

What IS writable: BitLocker, Memory Integrity, test signing, AutoRun, fast
startup, hibernation, SmartScreen and the two event-log sizes.

BitLocker is the highest-risk entry in the whole catalog, and its
`why_it_matters` says so in plain words rather than leaving it to the risk
enum.
