"""Accounts, credentials, and what an attacker can run once inside.

Everything here is either an LSA/Winlogon registry value or a `net accounts`
setting, so most entries revert exactly. Three conventions:

* `desired` on a numeric control is compared for EQUALITY. A machine already
  stricter than the catalog's value -- 2 cached logons against a desired 4 --
  therefore reads as "not at desired". That is a limitation of the comparison,
  not a finding about the machine, and it is recorded for the review dialog.
* HKCU values are read-only here for the same reason as WPAD: the elevated
  helper writes the administrator's hive, not the signed-in user's.
* A control that could lock somebody out of their own machine is `Risk.HIGH`,
  and the batch that carries one forces a restore point.
