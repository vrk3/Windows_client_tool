        "enforced, how many explicitly disabled, how many left at Windows' "
        "default. Each mitigation is its own setting; the census is not "
        "settable, and CFG and ASLR -- the two that are -- are controls "
        "in their own right.",

# Carried instruction (Task 5 addendum, Ruling 6) for whichever task binds
# check_service_wsearch and check_service_sysmain: DO NOT put them in
# NOT_A_CONTROL -- they are real, wireable controls. But their readers
# currently score a RUNNING service as red/bad (_svc_check(..., running_bad=
# True)), which is a false positive in a *security* dashboard: Windows
# Search and SysMain running is a performance/telemetry question, not attack
# surface. That polarity is retained-as-was on purpose -- it was not the
# reader's mistake to fix here, and the verdict belongs in the catalog, not
# in security_reader.py. When these two become catalog entries, give both
# `desired=None` ("no opinion") so a running service is never counted as a
# problem, while the card still shows the reader's honest status. Consequence
# for the pane's "Only problems" filter: it must key off `desired`, NOT off
# the reader's `color` field -- a reader may legitimately colour something
# amber/red that the catalog has no opinion about.
