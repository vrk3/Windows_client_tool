"""Changes stage, then apply as one batch. Nothing here touches the machine.

Two rules this module enforces, both of which exist because of something that
already went wrong elsewhere in this project:

* **Staging never reads the machine when the caller already knows the value.**
  `add()` takes an optional `from_value`; a card that has just rendered a
  reading passes it. Reading per click is the per-field-PowerShell trap the
  snapshot layer exists to remove, reintroduced in the UI -- and it is not
  theoretical, since `bitlocker_encryption_detail.read()` costs 6.11s on the
  machine this was written on.

* **A control cannot be staged to no value.** `SecurityControl.steps_for(None)`
  raises rather than quietly returning `off_steps`, because the old behaviour
  would have turned Windows Search off on a control the catalog explicitly has
  no opinion about. Staging `None` as a TARGET would reach that at apply time,
  in a worker thread, with no user in front of it. It is refused here instead,
  where the message can still name the control.

        A static revert command in the catalog cannot know what it is
        reverting TO, and BackupService cannot work it out either: it records
        a before-value for a registry write or a service change, and nothing
        at all for a command. So a script step carries a `revert_template`
        with `${old}` in it, and this fills that in from the value the machine
        had before the change was staged.

        Three ways `${old}` is resolved, in order:

        * `revert_values` maps the old value (as a string) to the token the
          cmdlet accepts. Required for anything that is not a plain number.
        * A bare int reverts to itself, so a 0-50 parameter does not need a
          table of 51 entries.
        * Anything else yields **no revert command**. That is deliberate in
          three cases that all exist in the real catalog: an unreadable
          `from_value`; a string off the machine, which must never be pasted
          into a shell command unmapped; and a value the map does not cover,
          which is exactly the threat-action controls -- Get-MpPreference
          reports 0 for an unconfigured severity and 0 is not a member of the
          ThreatAction enum, so no command reverts to it.
