r"""One measurement per tree, shared by every tab that wants it.

Overview, System Junk, Large Items and Quick Cleanup run overlapping
scanner sets, and each of them walks the same directories again. %TEMP% on
this machine is 47.36 GB across 46,825 directories and 53,926 files, a ~3s
walk, and it is measured by scan_temp_files AND scan_user_crash_dumps
(they are the same path) on the Overview, again on System Junk, and again
on every 60-second Quick Cleanup refresh.

The TTL is short on purpose. This is not a persistent index — it exists so
that opening the module and clicking through its tabs does not re-walk the
disk four times in twenty seconds. Anything older than that is measured
again, because the whole point of the pane is a current number.

Two properties this has to hold, and both are tested:

* **Callers get their own ScanItems.** The tabs toggle `selected` on the
  items they are handed, so serving the cached objects themselves would
  let one tab's checkboxes appear ticked in another.
* **A delete invalidates everything.** `delete_items` calls `invalidate()`.
  Serving a pre-delete measurement afterwards reports space as still
  reclaimable when it has already been freed.
