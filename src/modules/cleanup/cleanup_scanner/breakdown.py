r"""What is inside an item too big to be a single checkbox.

%TEMP% on the machine this was written for is 47.36 GB across 46,825
directories, and the Cleanup tab presented it as one row: "Temp Files —
47.4 GB". You could not see what was in it, could not pick part of it, and
ticking it deleted a directory a running process may be writing to. Opening
it up showed ~100 near-identical `wct_*` folders at 0.44 GB each — this
project's own pytest temp dirs — which is exactly the sort of thing someone
would want to know before agreeing to anything.

Measured lazily, when a row is expanded. The parent's total is already
known from the scan; walking every oversized item's children up front would
repeat the most expensive part of the sweep for rows nobody opens.
