r"""Where the user's data actually is, and which of it lives in the cloud.

Six scanners used to build their target list from `os.path.expanduser("~")`
plus a hardcoded folder name. That is wrong on any machine where a known
folder is redirected, which is the default once OneDrive Backup is on.
Measured on this machine: `~\Desktop` and `~\Pictures` do not exist at all,
and `~\Documents` holds 10 entries against the real folder's 225. A
missing directory is not an error to those scanners, so Large Items,
duplicates, old files and empty folders all quietly reported on a shadow
of the profile.

`SHGetKnownFolderPath` is the API Explorer itself uses, and it answers with
the redirected path. There is no registry read here on purpose: the shell
consults more than `User Shell Folders` (per-machine policy, and the
folder's own `desktop.ini` redirection), and reimplementing that is how you
get an answer that is right on the dev machine only.

The second thing this module knows is the trap that arrives WITH the fix.
Once the scanners reach a real OneDrive folder, anything that opens a file
hydrates it — Files On-Demand fetches the whole thing over the network.
`_hash_file_fast` opens every file in a size-collision group, so duplicate
detection would silently download gigabytes. `is_cloud_placeholder` answers
that from the file attributes, without opening anything.
