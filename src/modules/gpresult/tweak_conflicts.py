"""Cross-reference this app's own tweaks against the keys local Group Policy manages.

Why this exists: 286 of the ~2500 registry steps in `modules/tweaks/definitions`
write straight into Windows' *managed* policy branches (a key containing
`\\Policies\\`). Those branches do not belong to whoever wrote them last -- they
belong to the Registry client-side extension, which deletes and rewrites them
when it processes a GPO. A tweak this app applied by poking a policy value can
therefore be undone with no error, no prompt and no trace in the app's own
revert log.

Be careful about how loudly that is stated. With default settings the Registry
CSE *skips* processing when no GPO version has changed, so a hand-written policy
value can sit there untouched for weeks. The honest claim is "can be reverted
without warning" -- on the next `gpupdate /force`, GPO version bump or policy
edit -- and NOT "is reverted every 90 minutes". Every string this module
produces is worded to that standard.

The other half of the finding matters just as much: a tweak that writes the
same data the policy already sets is *duplicating* policy, which is untidy but
harmless, while one that writes different data is *fighting* policy, which it
will lose. Those two are reported separately and must never be collapsed.

Both inputs are injectable so the analysis is testable without touching this
machine: pass parsed tweak definitions and `PolFile`s, or let the real loaders
run. Nothing is loaded at import time -- ~800 tweak definitions is not a cost to
pay for `import`.
