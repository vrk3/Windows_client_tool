"""Shared PyInstaller Analysis() inputs for all three .spec files
(WinClientTool.spec, WinClientTool-console.spec, WinClientTool-portable.spec).

Kept as plain data here instead of copy-pasted into each spec so the three
builds' datas/hiddenimports lists can't silently drift out of sync — the
folder/console/portable builds are meant to differ only in EXE/COLLECT
packaging options, not in what gets analyzed and bundled.

Each .spec file adds itself to sys.path (spec files aren't run as part of a
package) before importing this module — see any of the three for the pattern.
