# Windows Client Tool

A comprehensive Windows 11 optimization and system diagnostics utility with a modern Qt6-based graphical interface.

## Features

### Disk Space & Logs
- **TreeSize**: A full disk-space analyser. Reads the NTFS `$MFT` directly
  when run elevated on an NTFS volume — a whole `C:` in about 20 seconds —
  and falls back to a directory walk everywhere else. Treemap, pie and bar
  charts; per-extension, per-file-group, per-owner and per-age breakdowns;
  saved scans, snapshots and comparison; duplicate finder; file search;
  scheduled scans; live watching of a scanned folder; exports to CSV, Excel,
  PDF, HTML, XML, JSON, SQLite and text. Besides local drives it can scan
  SSH/SFTP, WebDAV and Outlook mailboxes; S3, Azure Blob, SharePoint and
  Google Drive additionally need their vendor SDK installed (`boto3`,
  `azure-storage-blob`, `google-api-python-client`) and report themselves as
  unavailable until it is.
- **Log Viewer**: A CMTrace-style viewer for ConfigMgr logs and plain text
  alike. Severity colouring, live tailing that survives a log rollover, a
  case-insensitive filter, find with wrap-around, and it opens a
  several-hundred-megabyte log at its tail rather than trying to hold it all.

### System Analysis & Optimization
- **Dashboard**: Live monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Event Viewer**: Parse Windows Event logs (System, Application, Security)
- **CBS/DISM Logs**: Analyze component store and system repair logs
- **Windows Update**: Check and install pending updates
- **Process Explorer**: View running processes with resource usage
- **Performance Tuner**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- **Cleanup Scanner**: Find and remove unnecessary files

### System Information
- **Hardware Inventory**: Collect detailed hardware specifications
- **Driver Manager**: View and manage installed drivers
- **Windows Features**: Enable/disable optional Windows features
- **Network Diagnostics**: Analyze network adapter status and issues
- **Security Dashboard**: Review security settings and vulnerabilities
- **Certificates**: View and manage system certificates
- **Startup & Boot**: Startup programs and services, boot timing, and power
  and boot options — one module with a tab each

### Network
- **Network Diagnostics**: Connectivity checks, Wi-Fi analysis, the HOSTS
  file, and DNS/proxy settings — one module with a tab each

### Tools
- **Registry Explorer**: Browse and edit registry keys (backup-first)
- **Environment Variables**: View and edit system variables
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Manage task scheduler jobs
- **Shared Folders**: Manage network shares
- **Remote Tools**: Remote desktop and command line utilities

### Utilities
- **Tweaks**: Apply system optimization recommendations
- **Backup Service**: Config file backup and restore
- **System Report**: Generate comprehensive system health reports
